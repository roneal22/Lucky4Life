# Lucky4Life

Use Math.random() to choose a random set of 5 unique numbers to play in the Mass Lottery 
“Lucky for Life” game.  The numbers range from 1 to 48 - plus, one extra number called the “Lucky 
Ball” that is from 1 to 18.

Store the first 5 numbers in an array and store the lucky ball number separately.
Sort the numbers in the array.
Now determine how much your numbers would have won against real lottery results – you will 
enter these as described below using prompt.  Hint – use a default value with prompt() so that you 
do not have to type out the numbers every time.

Using only one prompt() or a textbox, ask the user to enter the first 5 winning numbers – 
the numbers should be entered separated by a space. 
Now use a second prompt() or textbox to enter the lucky ball number.
Compare the numbers in your pick to the winning numbers.
Note:  you may assume the input from prompt is valid.

Display the following on the page:
 Your pick - the 5 numbers must be sorted and displayed
 The winning numbers and lucky ball number
 How many of the first 5 numbers matched

 What the payout would be for your pick
